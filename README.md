This app helps you explore [AISC Shapes Database Version 14.0](http://www.aisc.org/content.aspx?id=2868) section property data.

This app is built on [AngularJS](http:angularjs.org).  It still has remnants of the tutorial I started from, hence "phones" in url and code.

I use [stasis](http://stasis.me) so that I can write with haml, sass, etc.  To build the app cd into the app directory and run <code>stasis -d 3000<code> (or some other port number).
